# Hey! 👋

My name is Daniel, and I am an experienced **Full-Stack Software Engineer**.

I have worked professionally with at least the following languages:

* Python 🐍 
* TypeScript 🕸 + 🖧
* Swift 🍏
* Kotlin 🤖
* Java 🤖 + 🖧

and am always interested in extending my collection by learning more 😉.

I currently work for **[OctoMind (🚧)](https://octomind.dev)** a developer productivity stealth startup. As the first engineer employee I am contributing throughout the entire product: From evaluating Product Opportunities to developing both ML algorithms or full-stack 

I enjoy any kind of technical challenges that can provide value to a customer, and am especially passionate about ✨ **Clean Code** ✨ and have signed the [Manifesto for Software Craftmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/#/en).


When I'm not building software I am often out hiking 🥾 + travelling 🛫 with my beautiful wife 👰 or playing the drums 🥁 in different orchestras in _Karlsruhe, Germany_ where I'm currently located.
